Iâ€™m an astrophysicist working at the University of Cambridge. My research involves understanding two main topics: the origins of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and the physics of winds and jets from accreting systems. These two subjects are inextricably linked.

On this site you can find more details about my research, talks and publications.
