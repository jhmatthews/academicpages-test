Cosmic Ray Acceleration

It is not yet understood where the highest energy cosmic rays originate. One of my main research goals is to figure out whether jets from AGN can accelerate the highest energy cosmic rays. More info here

Disc Winds in Accreting Systems

Outflows are ubiquitous in accreting systems. I spent my PhD developing a Monte Carlo radiative transfer and photoionization code, and used it to synthesize spectra of accreting objects with associated outflows.


Quasar and AGN unification and orientation

It would be rather elegant if all accreting supermassive black holes could essentially be described by their mass, Eddington ratio and viewing angle. While countless other complications doubtless exist, I am very interested in testing this paradigm. Image credit: Shen & Ho 2014.
